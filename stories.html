    <p> Dancing Derick was trapped in the elevator between floors two and three as he was going back up to class from lunch with his bag of McDonalds. After all of his fries and nuggets was gone. Derick began to panick as his phone was dying and he had no signal. He frantically tried calling for help but no one heard him as he was in the elevators stuck between floors two & three. When his phone was at one percent fearing death. Derick began a scared dance for Help. And someone walking by the elevator doors heard Derick's dance. The stranger notified the main lobby, and they notified the athorities who were able to free him from the elevator. After being stuck for about an hour he was finally free from the elevator. </p>

    <h3>Strolling Down Memory Lane -Flatiron</h3>
    <p> The teachers and most students were left with misty eyes and memories of their childhood. With songs from Hilliary Duff, and Aarons Party. One student had this to say, "Listening to those songs brought me back to when i was a child. And now i realize it brought me back a decade when those songs were popular. Also a very sad fact and a thing of reality is that we can never relive these moments no matter how much we want to or try. Even now this moment is slipping through our fingers like grains of sand."   </p>
